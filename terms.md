# Terms

When describing an outline it's common to use the following terms:

* _Parent_: The parent of an item is the item that directly contains it
* _Child_: The children of an item are the items that it directly contains
* _Sibling_: All children that have the same parent item are siblings
* _Root_: The topmost item in an outline is the root. The root item isn't visible in Bike's editor. In Bike the top level items are children of the hidden root item.
* _Branch_: A branch consists of an item together with all the items that it contains.
