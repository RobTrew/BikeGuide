# Terms

When describing an outline it's common to use the following terms:

* _Handle_: The triangle to the left of each item __&#x20;
* _Parent_: The parent of an item is the item that directly contains it
* _Child_: The children of an item are the items that it directly contains
* _Sibling_: All children that have the same parent item are siblings
* _Branch_: A branch consists of an item together with all the items that it contains.
* _Root_: The topmost item in an outline is the root item. The root isn't visible, instead the top level items in Bike are children of a hidden root item. The root has no parent item.
