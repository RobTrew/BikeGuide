# Bike Compatible Apps

Bike supports three file formats `bike`, `opml`, and `txt` as described in [Using Documents](using-bike/using-documents.md). Each is what I would describe as an "open" file format, a format for structured data that is already supported by other applications.

The OPML format in particular is a [common standard](http://opml.org) for outlines. If you want to share outlines with another app OPML is likely your best bet.

#### Bike Compatible Apps

This list welcome your feedback, additions, results, and notes. I have made this list by  searching and reading product pages and release notes. Some things may be out of date or just untrue. Please let me know what needs fixing!

* [Bike (macOS)](https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/) – Bike can read and write `bike`, `opml`, and `txt` directly to the file system as a supported file format. It can also read/write those formats to the clipboard.
* [Checkvist (Web)](https://checkvist.com) – Checkvist can import and export OPML. You can also copy and paste outlines between Checkvist  though you will need to do some cleanup on the results.
* [Drummer (Web + Electron)](http://drummer.scripting.com) – Drummer uses OPML as native format. You can import Bike OPML outlines into Drummer and export Drummer outlines to be used by Bike. You can also copy and paste outlines between Drummer and Bike using tab indented text.
* [Dynalist (Web)](https://dynalist.io) – Dynalist can import and export OPML. You can also copy and paste outlines between Dynalist and Bike  though you will need to do some cleanup on the results.
* [LittleOutliner (Web)](http://littleoutliner.com) – LittleOutliner uses OPML as native format. You can import Bike OPML outlines into LittleOutliner and export LittleOutliner outlines to be used by Bike. You can also copy and paste outlines between LittleOutliner and Bike using tab indented text.
* [Logseq (Electron)](https://logseq.com) – Logseq can import and export OPML. You can also copy and paste outlines between Logseq and Bike though you will need to do some cleanup on the results.
* [MindNode (macOS + iOS)](https://www.mindnode.com) – MindNode can import and export OPML. You can also copy and paste outlines between MindNote and Bike using tab indented text.
* [OmniOutliner (macOS + iOS)](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner) – OmniOutliner can import and export OPML. I think it can also use OPML as a standard document format (meaning no import export required). I think you can share an OPML document on iCloud and edit on iOS with OmniOutliner and on macOS with Bike. I have not tested this.
* [Outlinely (macOS + iOS)](https://glamdevelopment.com/outlinely) – Outlinely can import and export OPML. You can also copy and paste outlines between Outlinely and Bike though results may need cleanup.
* [Outliner (iOS)](https://carbonfin.com) – Outliner uses OPML as its native document format. I think you can share an OPML document on iCloud and edit on iOS with Outliner and on macOS with Bike. I have not tested this.
* [WorkFlowy (Web + iOS + Electron)](https://workflowy.com/) – WorkFlowy can import and export OPML. You can also copy and paste outlines between WorkFlowy and Bike though results may need cleanup.
* [Zavala (macOS + iOS)](https://zavala.vincode.io) – Zavala can import and export OPML. You can also copy and paste outlines between Zavala and Bike though you will need to do some cleanup on the results.
