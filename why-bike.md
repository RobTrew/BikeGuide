# Why Bike?

I got stuck. For the last few years I’ve worked on my version of the “next big thing”. Unfortunately it was so big that I could quite finish it. Then I saw this quote:

I realized that I was stuck building an aircraft carrier. I decided to start over and build Bike instead. Bike’s a simple tool. It's small enough to fully understand and then use as you see fit.

I’ve build a lot of outliners _like_ apps over the years. Bike is the first pure outliner that I’ve made. There’s no extra concepts, it’s just a hierarchy of text and some commands to navigate.

Bike is _fluid_.

Outlines can be confusing to work with. Bike smoothly animates your outline so making changes easier to see. Even simple typing is smoother than you’ve seen before. Your ideas flow across the screen instead of jumping from position to position.

Bike is small, but designed for real work. It's [fast](posts/moby-dick-workout/). It can handle big outlines that freeze other outliners. Fluid animations don't slow it down, Bike is also fast at basic things like scrolling and resizing. Bike is also scriptable, automate and extend it with your own workflows.

Bike is just getting started.

I’ve been building on the outliner idea for a long time, Bike is the next chapter. I hope you’ll give it a try, get a license, and let me know what to improve for the next release.
