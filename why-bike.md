# Why Bike?

For the last few years I worked on my version of the "next big thing". Unfortunately it was so big that I could never quite finish it. And then I started having doubts about the core idea.

I finally changed course last summer (2021). That's when I decided to build Bike–a fast and fluid outliner. I've already build a number of outliner like apps: TaskPaper–outline of projects and tasks, FoldingText–outline of markdown, Hog Bay Notebook–outline of folders and files.

Why Bike?

* Pure and simple outliner, nothing extra
* Small macOS native app with good performance on big files

Bike is also _fluid_. Outliners can get confusing when they make big changes to your view. I custom build Bike's text editor too smoothly animate these changes. Your ideas flow across the screen instead of jumping from position to position. This makes Bike easier to use, and in my experience just more fun too.

Bike is just getting started. I've been building on the outliner idea for a long time, Bike is the next chapter.
