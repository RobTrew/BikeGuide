# OPML Compatible Apps

Bike supports three file formats \`bike\`, \`opml\`, and \`txt\` as described in [Using Documents](using-bike/using-documents.md). The `opml` format is a common standard and supported by many other apps. This pages lists the supporting apps that I'm aware of.

This page needs your input. The sources for this guide are [available here](https://github.com/jessegrosjean/BikeGuide). Please make a pull request with your own OPTML compatible app additions. If you don't know how to make a pull request you can email [jesse@hogbaysoftware.com](https://app.gitbook.com/u/547e71f6f4dc4e020053185d) your suggestions. Thanks!

#### Read / Write Compatible

These applications can read and write OPML files directly. This is the best level of support because it means you can share the same outline file between applications without needing to import/export.

* [OmniOutliner (macOS + iOS)](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnioutliner)
* [Outliner (iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/outliner/id284455726)

#### Copy and Paste Compatible

These applications place OPML on the clipboard when you copy and paste. This makes it easy to move data between two compatible applications that are open on your computer.

* [MindNode (macOS + iOS)](https://www.mindnode.com)

#### Import / Export Compatible

These applications can import/export OPML into a proprietary outline format. Every applications listed in the Read / Write compatible section could also be listed here... but let's not do that and avoid some duplication.
