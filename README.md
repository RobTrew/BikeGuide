# Getting Started

Use Bike to record and process your ideas.

![This is Bike](.gitbook/assets/bike.png)

Items in Bike are organized into hierarchies. These hierarchies make up your outline. Above you can see that the Maine item is part of New England, and New England is part of the United States.

#### To create an item

* Press the `Return` key to create an item

#### To change an item's indentation level

* Press the `Tab` key to indent an item
* Press `Shift-Tab` key to unindent an item

#### To show and hide detail in your outline

* Click an item's triangle handle to collapse an item, hiding it's children
* Click that same handle to expand the item, showing it's children

#### To focus into a specific part of your outline, hiding everything else

* Command-Click an item's handle
* Command-Click on a focused item's handle to unfocus it

That's it, just a few commands, but once you internalize them and learn their keyboard shortcuts you've got a great place to think. Learning the keyboard shortcuts is important,  that's really how you'll get the most value out of Bike, when you can move around quickly without having think about those movements to much.
