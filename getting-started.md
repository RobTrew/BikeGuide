# Getting Started

![This is Bike](.gitbook/assets/bike.png)

Bike is an outliner.

Items in Bike are organized into hierarchies. These hierarchies make up you're our outline. Above you can see that the Maine item is part of New England, and New England is part of the United States.

#### To create an item

* Press the `Return` key to insert an item into your outline.

#### To change an item's indentation level

* Press the `Tab` key to indent an item
* Press `Shift-Tab` to unindent an item

#### To show and hide detail in your outline

* Click an item's triangle handle to collapse an item, hiding it's children
* Click that same handle to expand the item, showing it's children

#### To focus into a specific part of your outline, hiding everything else

* Command-Click an item's handle
* Command-Click on a focused item's handle to unfocus it

That's it, just a few commands, but once you internalize these commands and learn their keyboard shortcuts you've got a great place to think.
