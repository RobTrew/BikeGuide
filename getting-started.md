# Getting Started

![This is Bike](.gitbook/assets/bike.png)

Bike is an outliner.

Items in Bike are organized into hierarchies. This is our outline. Above you can see that the Maine item is part of New England, and New England is part of the United States.

#### To create an item

Use the `Return` key to insert a new item into your outline.

#### To change an item's indentation level

Use the `Tab` key to indent an item. Use `Shift-Tab` to unindent an item.

#### To hide details by collapsing an item

Click the triangle handle that's to the left of an item that has child item. This will collapse that item, hiding the child item.

#### To focus into a specific part of your outline, hiding everything else

`Command-Click` on the triangle handle that's next to the item you wish to focus into. When focused `Command-Click` on that same handle to focus back out.

That's it, just a few commands, but once you internalize them and their keyboard shortcuts you've got a great place to think.
