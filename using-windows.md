# Using Windows

Bike allows you to open multiple Windows of the same outline document. Each window can have different select, focus, and expand/collapse. Windows will be restored next time you open Bike.

* Use File > New Window to open a new window for the current outline

Bike also adds a new Windows > Float on Top command. This will make the current window float over all other windows, even when Bike isn't the active app.
