# Bike on iOS

_Preliminary documentation: Please_ [_report back_](https://support.hogbaysoftware.com/c/bike/22) _if you run into problems or have tips on how best to work with Bike outlines on iOS._

Bike doesn't run on iOS. To view and edit your Bike outlines on iOS you need to save to your iDrive using the OPML file format. You then need to access that outline on iOS with an outliner that supports OPML.

#### To access your Bike outlines on iOS

1. Create a new Bike outline.
2. Save the outline to your iCloud drive folder.
3. When saving use the OPML file format available in Bike's save dialogue.
4. On iOS open that file using your OPML compatible outliner

#### iOS apps that support OPML

It's important that the iOS app can read/write the OPML file directly. If it requires import/export it will be less useful. Please suggest other suitable outliners and I'll add them to this list. I think these apps will work from reading docs, but haven't tested. Again please report back. Thanks!
