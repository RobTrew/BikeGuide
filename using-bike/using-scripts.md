# Using Scripts

Use scripts to automate Bike and integrate with other apps.

**To try a script:**

1. Create a new test document in Bike
2. Open the "Script Editor" app that comes with your mac and paste the script into a new "Script Editor" document
3. Scripts are in either JavaScript or AppleScript. There's a pop up in the upper left of the Script Editor allowing you to choose the scripts format.
4. Press the "Play" button to run the script and test it out in your document.

**To install a script in the system script menu:**

Open the "Script Editor" app and choose Help > Script Editor Help. Search for the help section "Access your scripts using the Script menu". That will lead you through the steps of enabling and saving scripts into the system script menu.

You can also use [FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) or [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) to run your scripts with assigned keyboard shortcuts.
