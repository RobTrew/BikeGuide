# Using Check Panel

![Checking Panel](../.gitbook/assets/check.png)

Use the checking panel to find potential problems in your outline.

Checking will check your entire outline if you haven't focused into a specific branch. If you have focused your outline then checking will only check that focused region. Checking will always check into collapsed items and will expand them to show Check Next results.

* To show the checking panel and find the next issue use the menu item Edit > Checking > Check Next (`Command-;`)
* To hide the checking panel press the `Escape` key, or click the Done button.

#### To advance to the next suggestion

* Click the Next button in the checking panel
* Or use Edit > Checking > Check Next (`Command-;`)

#### To go back to the previous suggestion

* Click the Previous button in the checking panel
* Or use Edit > Checking > Check Previous (`Command-:`)

#### To select a correction

* Press the `Down` arrow to select any suggestion
* Or type your own correction into the text field

#### To apply a correction

* Click the `Replace` button in the checking panel
* Or press `Return` to apply the correction
