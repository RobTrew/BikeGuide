In addition to standard macOS window behavoir, Bike also supports:

#### Floating windows

To make the current Bike window float above all other windows check the menu item Window > Float on Top. Uncheck that same menu item to restore normal behavior.

#### Open a single document in multiple windows

To open a new window for an Bike document use the menu item File > New Window (`Option-Command-N`). Each window maintains it's own selection, focused item, and expanded item.
