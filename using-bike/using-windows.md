# Using Windows

First read [Manage app windows on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/work-with-app-windows-mchlp2469/12.0/mac/12.0) to learn the basics.

In addition to standard window behavior Bike allows:

#### Floating windows

Bike allows you to "float" a window over all your other macOS windows. This can be useful if you have a "notes" style outline that you always want visible.

Check the menu item Window > Float on Top to float the current Bike window over all other windows. Uncheck that menu item to restore normal overlapping window behavior.

#### Multiple windows viewing a single document

Bike allows you to view a single outline in multiple windows. This can be most useful if each window is focused into a different part of that outline.

To open a new window on an existing outline use the menu File > New Window (`Option-Command-N`).
