# Using Windows

First read [Manage app windows on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/work-with-app-windows-mchlp2469/12.0/mac/12.0) to learn the basics. In addition to that standard behavior Bike also allows:

#### Floating windows

Check the menu item "Window > Float on Top" to float the current Bike window over all other windows.

#### Multiple windows viewing a single document

To open a new window for an existing outline use the menu item "File > New Window" (`Option-Command-N`).
