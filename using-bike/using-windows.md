### Bike Window Options

#### To make a window float above all other windows

* Check the menu item Window > Float on Top
* Uncheck that same menu item to restore normal behavior.

#### To open a single document in multiple windows

* Use the menu item File > New Window (`Option-Command-N`)
* Each window maintains its own selection, focused row, and expanded row.

### Bike Window Restoration

macOS has a standard feature that saves windows when you quit an application and restores them next time you open the application.

To have your Bike save and restore your windows you need to do two things:

1. In macOS System Preferences > General make sure that the "Close windows when quitting an app" checkbox is _not_ checked. The setting should look like this: <img src="../.gitbook/assets/close-windows-when-quitting-app.png" alt="" data-size="line">
2. When you quit Bike you need to leave windows open that you want to be restored next time. If you close the windows before quitting Bike then no windows will be restored.

If you do those two things then Bike should save and restore windows and the focused row, collapsed rows, and the selection.
